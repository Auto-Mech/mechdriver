For now EStokTP.py is serving as a very rudimentary high level driver.
Ultimately need to write new overall driver - it is getting too long
Immediate needs:
Problems with BABS2, BABS3
Debug Frequency Projection

OHOCHOH not connected
(x) Special output in separate file
(vi) Run full set of reactions for testing
(viii) Presort by reaction class
(ix) Incorporate more mess writing - getting there
(x) Stereoisomer issues

EStokTP Features:
(1) Frequency projections
(2) IRC
(3) Small Curvatuve Tunneling
(4) Multi-dimensional rotors
(5) Isomerizations
(6) 2D Grid_opt - I think this is used in isomerization ts finding
(7) Torsions along IRC
(8) Composite energies
(9) Mess Writing: Started
(10) Run Rate Constants
(11) Robust testing of torsional optimization output - 

RCDriver Features:
(1) Anharmonicity
(2) MessPf Writing: Started
(3) Partition Function Reading
(4) NASA Polynomial generation: use makepoly.py from Sarah
(5) Rate Reading
(6) Rate fitting
(7) BAC
(8) CBH
(9) Arbitrary Composite Energies

AutoChem Features
(1) Automatic comparison of rate data with rate data in mechanism
(2) Automatic comparison of thermo data with thermo data in mechanism
(3) Rate classificiation

Debugging
(0) TS's for linear species
(1) Make all thermo run: pf finished - now need pf to thermo
(2) Make all rates run: Good progress
(3) Check thermo output quantitatively
(4) Check rate output quantitatively
(6) Make everything robust: Good progress
(7) Check that multiple versions of code running at same time works correctly: Good progress
(8) Check robustness of MOLPRO optimization and energies 

New Features to add
(1) CASPT2 grid_opt with Molpro
(2) Pressure Dependent Rate Constants
(3) Crude Monte Carlo sampling based partition functions
(4) Connect to KinBot
(5) MEP for Barrierless Reactions
(6) VRC-TST for barrierless
(7) Connect to other TS searches - e.g., Zimmerman and growing strings
(8) Add/enhance EStokTP style TS searching routines
(9) Mechanism generation
(10) Try SELA optimizer - is it an improvement over Gaussian's and/or Molpro's ...
(11) Proper commenting in code 
(12) Overarching manual
(13) Parallelization
(14) Automated 1DMin
(15) Automated Energy Transfer
(16) 2D Master Equation

New Elstruct Codes to Add
(1) Orca
(2) QChem
(3) NWChem
(4) MPQC 

Replace current frequency removal with one that removes lowest 5 or 6 modes based on linearity
Is CN + OH ts actually correct?
Should we save opt_grid ts scans? yes for now - it would complicate logic; same for running one conformer
