theory.dat
==========

Details various electronic structure methods.

Theory levels are given as a series of blocks like so:

General format::

    level <level_name>
            <keyword1 = value>
            <keyword2 = value>
              â€¦
    end level

Above, <level_name> serves as a descriptor of the method that is used in other parts of the code. This string can be whatever the user wishes. It must contain no whitespace.

Any number of these level blocks can be given in theory.dat. The only blocks used by the code are those specified in run.dat and models.dat.

program: electronic structure program to run

method: electronic structure method

basis: basis set

orb_res: orb restiction label

memory: memory per core, in GB

nprocs: number of cores to use

econv: energy convergence threshhold

gconv: geometry convergence threshhold

optcoords: coordinates to use for geometry optimization

three combos of orb_res labels: 'RR', 'UU', 'RU' 
where the first (second) label in each pair corresponds closed-shell (open-shell) species, where R andU refers to use of an restricted or unrestricted reference, respectively


program (if version does not exist, just try other version, need to see if parsing makes filesys okay)

maybe provide a link to elstruct for program (method/basis) availability
