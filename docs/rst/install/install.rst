Installation
=============
We have conda packages on the anaconda cloud for all of our packages. To install them,
set up an environment for AutoMech.  You can use the environment we have prepared for the
suite auto-mech-env.  Then activate your environment to get started

.. code-block:: python

    >>> conda env create auto-mech/auto-mech-env
    >>> conda activate auto-mech-env

For users new to conda  `Conda`_.

Each AutoMech package is also available on `GitHub`_.
