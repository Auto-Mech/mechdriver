Pre-Process Mechanism
*********************

Preparing a mechanism for running Auto-Mech is difficult. We made process easier

Only basis sorting done in AutoMech

Files
-----

    mechanism.dat
    species.csv
    sort.inp (maybe)


Adding stereochemistry to species
Adding thermo basis species
Sorting and Filtering Reactions


**********************
Post-Process Mechanism
**********************

Following rate-thermo calculation, we have tools to analyze it

Plotting
--------

    Plot rates, thermo

Checking
--------

    Check the mechanism

*****
Other
*****
    - rate fitting
